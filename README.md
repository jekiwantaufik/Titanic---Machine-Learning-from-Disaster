# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
Predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics

Description
üëãüõ≥Ô∏è Ahoy, welcome to Kaggle! You‚Äôre in the right place.
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition ‚Äì the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Read on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you‚Äôre ready to start competing, click on the "Join Competition button to create an account and gain access to the competition data. Then check out Alexis Cook‚Äôs Titanic Tutorial that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!

The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

How Kaggle‚Äôs Competitions Work
Join the Competition
Read about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.
Get to Work
Download the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.
Make a Submission
Upload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.
Check the Leaderboard
See how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard.
Improve Your Score
Check out the discussion forum to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.

Submission File Format:
You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.

The file should have exactly 2 columns:

PassengerId (sorted in any order)
Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)
Got it! I‚Äôm ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?
For Competition Help: Titanic Discussion Forum
Kaggle doesn‚Äôt have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you‚Äôll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!

A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks
As we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data & code.

In every competition, you‚Äôll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It‚Äôs an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition‚Äôs Notebooks here.

Evaluation
Goal
It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.
For each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.

Metric
Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as accuracy.

Submission File Format
You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.

The file should have exactly 2 columns:

PassengerId (sorted in any order)
Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)
